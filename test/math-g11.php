The area to the left (less than) $z=1.525$ is approximately 0.9363. The area to the right (greater than) is $1 - 0.9363 = 0.0637$. As a percentage, this is $6.37\%$, which rounds to $6.4\%$.',

So we have a factor of $(x+a)^2$. At $x = b$, the graph crosses the x-axis, indicating an odd multiplicity (e.g., a power of 1). So we have a factor of $(x-b)$.
