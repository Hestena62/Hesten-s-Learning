        <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.</p>
        
        <p>Winston Smith, his chin <span class="tooltip"><strong>nuzzled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">To press or rub against gently</span></span> into his breast in an effort to escape the <span class="tooltip"><strong>vile</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Extremely unpleasant; morally bad</span></span> wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of <span class="tooltip"><strong>gritty</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Containing small pieces of sand or stone</span></span> dust from entering along with him.</p>
        
        <p>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a <span class="tooltip"><strong>coloured</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having color; not black and white</span></span> poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It <span class="tooltip"><strong>depicted</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Shown or represented in a picture or story</span></span> simply an enormous face, more than a <span class="tooltip"><strong>metre</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A unit of length equal to 100 centimeters</span></span> wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black <span class="tooltip"><strong>moustache</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Hair growing on the upper lip</span></span> and <span class="tooltip"><strong>ruggedly</strong><span class="tooltiptext">In a rough or uneven way</span></span> handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a <span class="tooltip"><strong>varicose</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Relating to swollen and twisted veins</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>ulcer</strong><span class="tooltiptext">An open sore on the body</span></span> above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face <span class="tooltip"><strong>gazed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Looked steadily and intently</span></span> from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so <span class="tooltip"><strong>contrived</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Deliberately created rather than arising naturally</span></span> that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.</p>
        
        <p>Inside the flat a <span class="tooltip"><strong>fruity</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having a sweet taste or smell like fruit</span></span> voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an <span class="tooltip"><strong>oblong</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having an elongated shape</span></span> metal <span class="tooltip"><strong>plaque</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A flat, thin piece of metal with writing on it</span></span> like a <span class="tooltip"><strong>dulled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Made less sharp or intense</span></span> mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still <span class="tooltip"><strong>distinguishable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Able to be recognized as different</span></span>. The instrument (the <span class="tooltip"><strong>telescreen</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A device that both transmits and receives television signals</span></span>, it was called) could be <span class="tooltip"><strong>dimmed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Made darker or less bright</span></span>, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the <span class="tooltip"><strong>meagreness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The state of being lacking in quantity or quality</span></span> of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally <span class="tooltip"><strong>sanguine</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Optimistic or positive, especially in a difficult situation</span></span>, his skin <span class="tooltip"><strong>roughened</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Made uneven or coarse</span></span> by <span class="tooltip"><strong>coarse</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Rough or harsh in texture</span></span> soap and <span class="tooltip"><strong>blunt</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having a dull edge or point</span></span> razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.</p>
        
        <p>Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little <span class="tooltip"><strong>eddies</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Circular movements of water or air</span></span> of wind were <span class="tooltip"><strong>whirling</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Moving rapidly in a circle</span></span> dust and torn paper into <span class="tooltip"><strong>spirals</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Curves that wind around a central point</span></span>, and though the sun was shining and the sky a <span class="tooltip"><strong>harsh</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Unpleasantly rough or jarring</span></span> blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were <span class="tooltip"><strong>plastered</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Covered with a thick layer</span></span> everywhere. The black-<span class="tooltip"><strong>moustachio'd</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having a moustache</span></span> face gazed down from every <span class="tooltip"><strong>commanding</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having a position of authority</span></span> corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter <span class="tooltip"><strong>skimmed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Moved quickly just above a surface</span></span> down between the roofs, <span class="tooltip"><strong>hovered</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Remained suspended in air</span></span> for an instant like a <span class="tooltip"><strong>bluebottle</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A type of blowfly with a metallic blue body</span></span>, and darted away again with a <span class="tooltip"><strong>curving</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Bending in a smooth, continuous shape</span></span> flight. It was the police <span class="tooltip"><strong>patrol</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A group of people who keep watch over an area</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>snooping</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Prying into something that is not one's business</span></span> into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.</p>
        
        <p>Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the <span class="tooltip"><strong>overfulfilment</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Exceeding what was required or expected</span></span> of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted <span class="tooltip"><strong>simultaneously</strong><span class="tooltiptext">At the same time</span></span>. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low <span class="tooltip"><strong>whisper</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Speaking very softly</span></span>, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque <span class="tooltip"><strong>commanded</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Had control over</span></span>, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement <span class="tooltip"><strong>scrutinized</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Examined in great detail</span></span>.</p>
        
        <p>Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered <span class="tooltip"><strong>vast</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Extremely large in size</span></span> and white above the <span class="tooltip"><strong>grimy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Covered with dirt</span></span> landscape. This, he thought with a sort of <span class="tooltip"><strong>vague</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Not clearly expressed or understood</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>distaste</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A feeling of dislike</span></span>--this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these <span class="tooltip"><strong>vistas</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Wide views of a physical area</span></span> of <span class="tooltip"><strong>rotting</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Decaying</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>nineteenth-century</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Relating to the years 1801-1900</span></span> houses, their sides <span class="tooltip"><strong>shored</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Supported with beams or props</span></span> up with <span class="tooltip"><strong>baulks</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Large beams of timber</span></span> of timber, their windows <span class="tooltip"><strong>patched</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Mended with a piece of material</span></span> with cardboard and their roofs with <span class="tooltip"><strong>corrugated</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having parallel ridges and furrows</span></span> iron, their <span class="tooltip"><strong>crazy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Unstable or mentally deranged</span></span> garden walls <span class="tooltip"><strong>sagging</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Hanging or sinking down</span></span> in all directions? And the bombed sites where the <span class="tooltip"><strong>plaster</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A soft mixture used for coating walls</span></span> dust swirled in the air and the <span class="tooltip"><strong>willow-herb</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A type of plant with pink flowers</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>straggled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Grew in a disorderly way</span></span> over the <span class="tooltip"><strong>heaps</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Piles of something</span></span> of <span class="tooltip"><strong>rubble</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Broken pieces of stone or brick</span></span>; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up <span class="tooltip"><strong>sordid</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Dirty or unpleasant</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>colonies</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Groups of people living in a new area</span></span> of wooden <span class="tooltip"><strong>dwellings</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Houses or places to live</span></span> like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit <span class="tooltip"><strong>tableaux</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Groups of models or pictures</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>occurring</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Happening</span></span> against no background and mostly <span class="tooltip"><strong>unintelligible</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Impossible to understand</span></span>.</p>
        
        <p>The Ministry of Truth--Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official language of Oceania. For an account of its structure and etymology see Appendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous <span class="tooltip"><strong>pyramidal</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Shaped like a pyramid</span></span> structure of <span class="tooltip"><strong>glittering</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Shining with reflected light</span></span> white <span class="tooltip"><strong>concrete</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A building material made from cement</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>soaring</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Flying or rising high in the air</span></span> up, <span class="tooltip"><strong>terrace</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A level area next to a building</span></span> after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in <span class="tooltip"><strong>elegant</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Graceful and attractive in appearance</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>lettering</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Letters written or printed</span></span>, the three <span class="tooltip"><strong>slogans</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Short, memorable phrases</span></span> of the Party:</p>
        
        <p>WAR IS PEACE<br>
        FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br>
        IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</p>
        
        <p>The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding <span class="tooltip"><strong>ramifications</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Complex consequences or effects</span></span> below. Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they <span class="tooltip"><strong>dwarf</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Make something seem small in comparison</span></span> the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four <span class="tooltip"><strong>Ministries</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Government departments</span></span> between which the entire <span class="tooltip"><strong>apparatus</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The structure or organization of something</span></span> of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, <span class="tooltip"><strong>entertainment</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Activities that provide enjoyment</span></span>, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which <span class="tooltip"><strong>maintained</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Kept in existence or continued</span></span> law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for <span class="tooltip"><strong>economic</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Related to the economy</span></span> affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.</p>
        
        <p>The Ministry of Love was the really <span class="tooltip"><strong>frightening</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Causing fear or alarm</span></span> one. There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by <span class="tooltip"><strong>penetrating</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Getting into or through something</span></span> through a <span class="tooltip"><strong>maze</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A complex network of paths</span></span> of <span class="tooltip"><strong>barbed-wire</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Wire with sharp points along it</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>entanglements</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Things that are twisted together</span></span>, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun <span class="tooltip"><strong>nests</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Comfortable or sheltered places</span></span>. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were <span class="tooltip"><strong>roamed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Moved about without a clear direction</span></span> by <span class="tooltip"><strong>gorilla-faced</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having a face like a gorilla</span></span> guards in black uniforms, armed with <span class="tooltip"><strong>jointed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having joints where movement can occur</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>truncheons</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Short, thick sticks used as weapons</span></span>.</p>
        
        <p>Winston turned round <span class="tooltip"><strong>abruptly</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Suddenly and unexpectedly</span></span>. He had set his <span class="tooltip"><strong>features</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Parts of a person's face</span></span> into the expression of quiet <span class="tooltip"><strong>optimism</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Hopefulness about the future</span></span> which it was <span class="tooltip"><strong>advisable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Recommended to do</span></span> to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had <span class="tooltip"><strong>sacrificed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Given up something valuable</span></span> his lunch in the <span class="tooltip"><strong>canteen</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A place where food is served</span></span>, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a <span class="tooltip"><strong>hunk</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A large piece of something</span></span> of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of <span class="tooltip"><strong>colourless</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having no color</span></span> liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a <span class="tooltip"><strong>sickly</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Causing a feeling of nausea</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>oily</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Containing or covered with oil</span></span> smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, <span class="tooltip"><strong>nerve</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Gave courage to oneself</span></span>d himself for a shock, and <span class="tooltip"><strong>gulped</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Swallowed quickly</span></span> it down like a dose of medicine. Instantly his face turned <span class="tooltip"><strong>scarlet</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Bright red</span></span> and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like <span class="tooltip"><strong>nitric</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Relating to nitric acid</span></span> acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the <span class="tooltip"><strong>sensation</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A physical feeling</span></span> of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a <span class="tooltip"><strong>crumpled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Crushed into wrinkles</span></span> packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and <span class="tooltip"><strong>incautiously</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Without being careful</span></span> held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful.</p>
        
        <p>He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, <span class="tooltip"><strong>quarto-sized</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having the size of a quarto book</span></span> blank book with a red back and a <span class="tooltip"><strong>marbled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having a pattern like marble</span></span> cover.</p>
        
        <p>For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there was a shallow <span class="tooltip"><strong>alcove</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A small recess in a room</span></span> in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual <span class="tooltip"><strong>geography</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The physical features of an area</span></span> of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.</p>
        
        <p>But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth <span class="tooltip"><strong>creamy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having the color of cream</span></span> paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a <span class="tooltip"><strong>frowsy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Untidy and dirty</span></span> little junk-shop in a <span class="tooltip"><strong>slummy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Relating to a slum</span></span> quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been <span class="tooltip"><strong>stricken</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Affected by something unpleasant</span></span> immediately by an <span class="tooltip"><strong>overwhelming</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Very great in amount</span></span> desire to <span class="tooltip"><strong>possess</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Have or own something</span></span> it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ('<span class="tooltip"><strong>dealing</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Engaging in business</span></span> on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it <span class="tooltip"><strong>guiltily</strong><span class="tooltiptext">With a feeling of having done wrong</span></span> home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a <span class="tooltip"><strong>compromising</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Bringing into disrepute</span></span> possession.</p>
        
        <p>The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if <span class="tooltip"><strong>detected</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Discovered or noticed</span></span> it was <span class="tooltip"><strong>reasonably</strong><span class="tooltiptext">To a moderate degree</span></span> certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a <span class="tooltip"><strong>forced-labour</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Compulsory work</span></span> camp. Winston <span class="tooltip"><strong>fitted</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Attached or joined</span></span> a <span class="tooltip"><strong>nib</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The pointed end of a pen</span></span> into the penholder and sucked it to get the <span class="tooltip"><strong>grease</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Oily or fatty matter</span></span> off. The pen was an <span class="tooltip"><strong>archaic</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Very old or old-fashioned</span></span> instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had <span class="tooltip"><strong>procured</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Obtained something</span></span> one, <span class="tooltip"><strong>furtively</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Secretly</span></span> and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to <span class="tooltip"><strong>dictate</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Say words for someone else to write down</span></span> everything into the <span class="tooltip"><strong>speak-write</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A device that converts speech to text</span></span> which was of course impossible for his present purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then <span class="tooltip"><strong>faltered</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Hesitated or stumbled</span></span> for just a second. A <span class="tooltip"><strong>tremor</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A shaking movement</span></span> had gone through his <span class="tooltip"><strong>bowels</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The intestines</span></span>. To mark the paper was the <span class="tooltip"><strong>decisive</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Settling an issue</span></span> act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:</p>
        
        <p>April 4th, 1984.</p>
        
        <p>He sat back. A sense of complete <span class="tooltip"><strong>helplessness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Inability to defend oneself</span></span> had <span class="tooltip"><strong>descended</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Moved downward</span></span> upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any <span class="tooltip"><strong>certainty</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The state of being sure</span></span> that this was 1984. It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two. For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind <span class="tooltip"><strong>hovered</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Remained suspended in one place</span></span> for a moment round the <span class="tooltip"><strong>doubtful</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Uncertain</span></span> date on the page, and then <span class="tooltip"><strong>fetched</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Went and got something</span></span> up with a bump against the Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK. For the first time the <span class="tooltip"><strong>magnitude</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The great size or extent of something</span></span> of what he had <span class="tooltip"><strong>undertaken</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Started or begun</span></span> came home to him. How could you <span class="tooltip"><strong>communicate</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Share information with others</span></span> with the future? It was of its <span class="tooltip"><strong>nature</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The basic qualities of something</span></span> impossible. Either the future would <span class="tooltip"><strong>resemble</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Look like or be similar to</span></span> the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his <span class="tooltip"><strong>predicament</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A difficult situation</span></span> would be <span class="tooltip"><strong>meaningless</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having no meaning</span></span>.</p>
        
        <p>For some time he sat <span class="tooltip"><strong>gazing</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Looking steadily at something</span></span> stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had changed over to <span class="tooltip"><strong>strident</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Loud and harsh</span></span> military music. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of <span class="tooltip"><strong>expressing</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Conveying thoughts or feelings</span></span> himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the <span class="tooltip"><strong>interminable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Endless or seemingly endless</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>restless</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Unable to rest or relax</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>monologue</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A long speech by one person</span></span> that had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had <span class="tooltip"><strong>dried</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Become dry</span></span> up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun <span class="tooltip"><strong>itching</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Causing an uncomfortable sensation on the skin</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>unbearably</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Too painful or difficult to bear</span></span>. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became <span class="tooltip"><strong>inflamed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Red, swollen, and sore</span></span>. The seconds were <span class="tooltip"><strong>ticking</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making a regular short sound</span></span> by. He was conscious of nothing except the <span class="tooltip"><strong>blankness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The state of being empty</span></span> of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the <span class="tooltip"><strong>blaring</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making a loud, harsh noise</span></span> of the music, and a slight <span class="tooltip"><strong>booziness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The state of being slightly drunk</span></span> caused by the gin.</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only <span class="tooltip"><strong>imperfectly</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Not perfectly</span></span> aware of what he was setting down. His small but childish handwriting <span class="tooltip"><strong>straggled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Went in different directions</span></span> up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops:</p>
        
        <p>April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean. Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him <span class="tooltip"><strong>wallowing</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Rolling about in mud or water</span></span> along in the water like a <span class="tooltip"><strong>porpoise</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A type of small whale</span></span>, then you saw him through the helicopters <span class="tooltip"><strong>gunsights</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A device for aiming a gun</span></span>, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to <span class="tooltip"><strong>burrow</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Dig a hole or tunnel</span></span> right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and <span class="tooltip"><strong>comforting</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making someone feel less sad</span></span> him although she was blue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to <span class="tooltip"><strong>matchwood</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Small pieces of wood</span></span>. then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of <span class="tooltip"><strong>applause</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Clapping to show approval</span></span> from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never----</p>
        
        <p>Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from <span class="tooltip"><strong>cramp</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A painful tightening of muscles</span></span>. He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.</p>
        
        <p>It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so <span class="tooltip"><strong>nebulous</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Vague or ill-defined</span></span> could be said to happen.</p>
        
        <p>It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the <span class="tooltip"><strong>cubicles</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Small, separated spaces in an office</span></span> and <span class="tooltip"><strong>grouping</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Putting into groups</span></span> them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably--since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a <span class="tooltip"><strong>bold-looking</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having a confident appearance</span></span> girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a <span class="tooltip"><strong>freckled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Covered with small brown spots</span></span> face, and <span class="tooltip"><strong>swift</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Happening quickly</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>athletic</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Physically strong and fit</span></span> movements. A narrow scarlet sash, <span class="tooltip"><strong>emblem</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A symbol representing something</span></span> of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the <span class="tooltip"><strong>shapeliness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having an attractive shape</span></span> of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the <span class="tooltip"><strong>atmosphere</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The general mood of a place</span></span> of <span class="tooltip"><strong>hockey-fields</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Areas for playing hockey</span></span> and cold baths and <span class="tooltip"><strong>community</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A group of people living together</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>hikes</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Long walks in the countryside</span></span> and general <span class="tooltip"><strong>clean-mindedness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having pure thoughts</span></span> which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most <span class="tooltip"><strong>bigoted</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having strong, unreasonable beliefs</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>adherents</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Supporters of a particular belief</span></span> of the Party, the <span class="tooltip"><strong>swallowers</strong><span class="tooltiptext">People who believe something completely</span></span> of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of <span class="tooltip"><strong>unorthodoxy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Beliefs that differ from accepted standards</span></span>. But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick <span class="tooltip"><strong>sidelong</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Directed to the side</span></span> glance which seemed to <span class="tooltip"><strong>pierce</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Go through or into something</span></span> right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.</p>
        
        <p>The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his <span class="tooltip"><strong>formidable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Inspiring fear through size or power</span></span> appearance he had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's <span class="tooltip"><strong>urbane</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Polite and sophisticated</span></span> manner and his <span class="tooltip"><strong>prize-fighter's</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A professional boxer</span></span> physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope--that O'Brien's political <span class="tooltip"><strong>orthodoxy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Conforming to what is generally accepted</span></span> was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it <span class="tooltip"><strong>irresistibly</strong><span class="tooltiptext">In a way that cannot be resisted</span></span>. And again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away. A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.</p>
        
        <p>The next moment a <span class="tooltip"><strong>hideous</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Extremely ugly</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>grinding</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making a harsh, scraping sound</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>screech</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A high, piercing cry</span></span>, as of some <span class="tooltip"><strong>monstrous</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Enormous and frightening</span></span> machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room. It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and <span class="tooltip"><strong>bristled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Stood up like bristles</span></span> the hair at the back of one's neck. The Hate had started.</p>
        
        <p>As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were <span class="tooltip"><strong>hisses</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Sounds like a long 's'</span></span> here and there among the audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of <span class="tooltip"><strong>mingled</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Mixed together</span></span> fear and disgust. Goldstein was the <span class="tooltip"><strong>renegade</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A person who abandons a cause</span></span> and <span class="tooltip"><strong>backslider</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Someone who reverts to worse behavior</span></span> who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been <span class="tooltip"><strong>condemned</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Expressed complete disapproval of</span></span> to death, and had <span class="tooltip"><strong>mysteriously</strong><span class="tooltiptext">In a way that is difficult to understand</span></span> escaped and disappeared. The <span class="tooltip"><strong>programmes</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Plans of activities</span></span> of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the <span class="tooltip"><strong>principal</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Most important</span></span> figure. He was the <span class="tooltip"><strong>primal</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Earliest or original</span></span> traitor, the earliest <span class="tooltip"><strong>defiler</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Someone who makes something impure</span></span> of the Party's purity. All <span class="tooltip"><strong>subsequent</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Following in time</span></span> crimes against the Party, all <span class="tooltip"><strong>treacheries</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Acts of betrayal</span></span>, acts of <span class="tooltip"><strong>sabotage</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Deliberate destruction of property</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>heresies</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Beliefs contrary to orthodox doctrine</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>deviations</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Departures from an accepted course</span></span>, sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and <span class="tooltip"><strong>hatching</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Planning in secret</span></span> his <span class="tooltip"><strong>conspiracies</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Secret plans to do something wrong</span></span>: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign <span class="tooltip"><strong>paymasters</strong><span class="tooltiptext">People who provide money for illegal activities</span></span>, perhaps even--so it was occasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.</p>
        
        <p>Winston's <span class="tooltip"><strong>diaphragm</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A muscle below the lungs</span></span> was <span class="tooltip"><strong>constricted</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Made narrower</span></span>. He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy <span class="tooltip"><strong>aureole</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A circle of light</span></span> of white hair and a small <span class="tooltip"><strong>goatee</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A small beard on a man's chin</span></span> beard--a clever face, and yet somehow inherently <span class="tooltip"><strong>despicable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Deserving hatred</span></span>, with a kind of <span class="tooltip"><strong>senile</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Related to old age</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>silliness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Foolish behavior</span></span> in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual <span class="tooltip"><strong>venomous</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Full of poison or malice</span></span> attack upon the <span class="tooltip"><strong>doctrines</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Beliefs or principles</span></span> of the Party--an attack so <span class="tooltip"><strong>exaggerated</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Represented as greater than it is</span></span> and <span class="tooltip"><strong>perverse</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Showing a deliberate desire to behave badly</span></span> that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just <span class="tooltip"><strong>plausible</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Seeming reasonable</span></span> enough to fill one with an <span class="tooltip"><strong>alarmed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Feeling fear</span></span> feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was <span class="tooltip"><strong>denouncing</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Publicly condemning</span></span> the <span class="tooltip"><strong>dictatorship</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Government by a ruler with total power</span></span> of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and all this in rapid <span class="tooltip"><strong>polysyllabic</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having many syllables</span></span> speech which was a sort of <span class="tooltip"><strong>parody</strong><span class="tooltiptext">An imitation of something for comic effect</span></span> of the <span class="tooltip"><strong>habitual</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Done regularly</span></span> style of the <span class="tooltip"><strong>orators</strong><span class="tooltiptext">People who give speeches</span></span> of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein's <span class="tooltip"><strong>specious</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Misleading in appearance</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>claptrap</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Nonsense</span></span> covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army--row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to Goldstein's <span class="tooltip"><strong>bleating</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making a sound like a sheep</span></span> voice.</p>
        
        <p>Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, <span class="tooltip"><strong>uncontrollable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Unable to be controlled</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>exclamations</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Sudden cries</span></span> of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. The <span class="tooltip"><strong>self-satisfied</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Pleased with oneself</span></span> sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. He was an object of hatred more <span class="tooltip"><strong>constant</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Happening all the time</span></span> than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were <span class="tooltip"><strong>refuted</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Proven to be wrong</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>smashed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Broken violently</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>ridiculed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Made fun of</span></span>, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh <span class="tooltip"><strong>dupes</strong><span class="tooltiptext">People who are easily deceived</span></span> waiting to be <span class="tooltip"><strong>seduced</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Persuaded to do something wrong</span></span> by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not <span class="tooltip"><strong>unmasked</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Had their true identity revealed</span></span> by the Thought Police.</p>
        
        <p>He was the commander of a vast <span class="tooltip"><strong>shadowy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Mysterious and secretive</span></span> army, an <span class="tooltip"><strong>underground</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Operating secretly</span></span> network of <span class="tooltip"><strong>conspirators</strong><span class="tooltiptext">People involved in secret plans</span></span> dedicated to the <span class="tooltip"><strong>overthrow</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Removal from power</span></span> of the State. The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a <span class="tooltip"><strong>compendium</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A collection of detailed information</span></span> of all the <span class="tooltip"><strong>heresies</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Beliefs contrary to orthodox doctrine</span></span>, of which Goldstein was the author and which <span class="tooltip"><strong>circulated</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Passed from person to person</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>clandestinely</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Secretly</span></span> here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it.</p>
        
        <p>In its second minute the Hate rose to a <span class="tooltip"><strong>frenzy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Wild and disorderly excitement</span></span>. People were <span class="tooltip"><strong>leaping</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Jumping high</span></span> up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the <span class="tooltip"><strong>maddening</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making one extremely angry</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>bleating</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making a sound like a sheep</span></span> voice that came from the screen. The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was <span class="tooltip"><strong>flushed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Red in the face</span></span>. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest <span class="tooltip"><strong>swelling</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Becoming larger</span></span> and <span class="tooltip"><strong>quivering</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Shaking slightly</span></span> as though he were standing up to the <span class="tooltip"><strong>assault</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A physical attack</span></span> of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine! Swine! Swine!' and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued <span class="tooltip"><strong>inexorably</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Unable to be stopped</span></span>. In a <span class="tooltip"><strong>lucid</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Clearly expressed</span></span> moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous <span class="tooltip"><strong>ecstasy</strong><span class="tooltiptext">An overwhelming feeling of happiness</span></span> of fear and <span class="tooltip"><strong>vindictiveness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A desire for revenge</span></span>, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a <span class="tooltip"><strong>sledge-hammer</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A heavy hammer</span></span>, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an <span class="tooltip"><strong>electric</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Related to electricity</span></span> current, turning one even against one's will into a <span class="tooltip"><strong>grimacing</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making a twisted expression</span></span>, screaming <span class="tooltip"><strong>lunatic</strong><span class="tooltiptext">An insane person</span></span>. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, <span class="tooltip"><strong>undirected</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Not aimed at a particular target</span></span> emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a <span class="tooltip"><strong>blowlamp</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A tool that produces a hot flame</span></span>. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret <span class="tooltip"><strong>loathing</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A feeling of intense dislike</span></span> of Big Brother changed into <span class="tooltip"><strong>adoration</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Deep love and respect</span></span>, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an <span class="tooltip"><strong>invincible</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Too powerful to be defeated</span></span>, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the <span class="tooltip"><strong>hordes</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Large crowds</span></span> of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some <span class="tooltip"><strong>sinister</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Giving the impression of evil</span></span> <span class="tooltip"><strong>enchanter</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A person who uses magic</span></span>, capable by the mere power of his voice of <span class="tooltip"><strong>wrecking</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Destroying completely</span></span> the structure of civilization.</p>
        
        <p>It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that by a <span class="tooltip"><strong>voluntary</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Done willingly</span></span> act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one <span class="tooltip"><strong>wrenches</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Pulls or twists violently</span></span> one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful <span class="tooltip"><strong>hallucinations</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Experiences involving seeing things that are not there</span></span> flashed through his mind. He would <span class="tooltip"><strong>flog</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Beat with a whip</span></span> her to death with a rubber <span class="tooltip"><strong>truncheon</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A short, thick stick used as a weapon</span></span>. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would <span class="tooltip"><strong>ravish</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Carry off by force</span></span> her and cut her throat at the moment of <span class="tooltip"><strong>climax</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The most intense point</span></span>. Better than before, moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the <span class="tooltip"><strong>odious</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Extremely unpleasant</span></span> scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of <span class="tooltip"><strong>chastity</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The state of not having sexual relationships</span></span>.</p>
        
        <p>The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his <span class="tooltip"><strong>sub-machine</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A type of gun</span></span> gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually <span class="tooltip"><strong>flinched</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Made a quick, nervous movement</span></span> backwards in their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired, black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals:</p>
        
        <p>WAR IS PEACE<br>
        FREEDOM IS SLAVERY<br>
        IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</p>
        
        <p>But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a <span class="tooltip"><strong>tremulous</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Shaking slightly</span></span> murmur that sounded like 'My Saviour!' she extended her arms towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.</p>
        
        <p>At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of 'B-B!...B-B!'--over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B' and the second--a heavy, <span class="tooltip"><strong>murmurous</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Making a low continuous sound</span></span> sound, somehow curiously <span class="tooltip"><strong>savage</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Fierce and violent</span></span>, in the background of which one seemed to hear the <span class="tooltip"><strong>stamp</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A sound of feet hitting the ground</span></span> of naked feet and the <span class="tooltip"><strong>throbbing</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Pulsating rhythmically</span></span> of <span class="tooltip"><strong>tom-toms</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A type of drum</span></span>. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a <span class="tooltip"><strong>refrain</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A repeated part of a song or poem</span></span> that was often heard in moments of <span class="tooltip"><strong>overwhelming</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Very great in amount</span></span> emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and <span class="tooltip"><strong>majesty</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Impressive beauty or dignity</span></span> of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of <span class="tooltip"><strong>self-hypnosis</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The act of hypnotizing oneself</span></span>, a deliberate <span class="tooltip"><strong>drowning</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Dying through being underwater</span></span> of <span class="tooltip"><strong>consciousness</strong><span class="tooltiptext">The state of being aware</span></span> by means of rhythmic noise.</p>
        
        <p>Winston's <span class="tooltip"><strong>entrails</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Internal organs</span></span> seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general <span class="tooltip"><strong>delirium</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A state of excitement and confusion</span></span>, but this <span class="tooltip"><strong>sub-human</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Less than human</span></span> chanting of 'B-B!...B-B!' always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To <span class="tooltip"><strong>dissemble</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Hide one's true feelings</span></span> your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might <span class="tooltip"><strong>conceivably</strong><span class="tooltiptext">It is possible to imagine</span></span> have <span class="tooltip"><strong>betrayed</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Revealed unintentionally</span></span> him. And it was exactly at this moment that the <span class="tooltip"><strong>significant</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Having a particular meaning</span></span> thing happened--if, indeed, it did happen.</p>
        
        <p>Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But there was a <span class="tooltip"><strong>fraction</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A small part of something</span></span> of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew--yes, he KNEW!--that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An <span class="tooltip"><strong>unmistakable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Impossible to mistake</span></span> message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. 'I am with you,' O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. 'I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don't worry, I am on your side!' And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and O'Brien's face was as <span class="tooltip"><strong>inscrutable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Impossible to understand</span></span> as everybody else's.</p>
        
        <p>That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such incidents never had any <span class="tooltip"><strong>sequel</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Something that follows</span></span>. All that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all--perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not. There was no evidence, only <span class="tooltip"><strong>fleeting</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Lasting for a very short time</span></span> glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: <span class="tooltip"><strong>snatches</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Small pieces</span></span> of overheard conversation, faint <span class="tooltip"><strong>scribbles</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Messy writing</span></span> on lavatory walls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an <span class="tooltip"><strong>equivocal</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Open to more than one interpretation</span></span> glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that was a <span class="tooltip"><strong>memorable</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Worth remembering</span></span> event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live.</p>
        
        <p>Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin was rising from his stomach.</p>
        
        <p>His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid <span class="tooltip"><strong>voluptuously</strong><span class="tooltiptext">In a way that gives sensual pleasure</span></span> over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals--</p>
        
        <p>DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER<br>
        DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER<br>
        DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER<br>
        DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER<br>
        DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER</p>
        
        <p>over and over again, filling half a page.</p>
        
        <p>He could not help feeling a <span class="tooltip"><strong>twinge</strong><span class="tooltiptext">A sudden sharp pain</span></span> of <span class="tooltip"><strong>panic</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Sudden fear</span></span>. It was <span class="tooltip"><strong>absurd</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Wildly unreasonable</span></span>, since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.</p>
        
        <p>He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he <span class="tooltip"><strong>refrained</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Stopped oneself from doing something</span></span> from writing it, made no difference. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go on with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just the same. He had committed--would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.</p>
        
        <p>It was always at night--the arrests invariably happened at night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were <span class="tooltip"><strong>abolished</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Formally ended</span></span>, <span class="tooltip"><strong>annihilated</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Destroyed completely</span></span>: VAPORIZED was the usual word.</p>
        
        <p>For a moment he was seized by a kind of <span class="tooltip"><strong>hysteria</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Exaggerated or uncontrollable emotion</span></span>. He began writing in a hurried untidy <span class="tooltip"><strong>scrawl</strong><span class="tooltiptext">Messy handwriting</span></span>:</p>
        
        <p>theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother----</p>
        
        <p>He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking at the door.</p>
        
        <p>Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated. The worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got up and moved heavily towards the door.</p>
