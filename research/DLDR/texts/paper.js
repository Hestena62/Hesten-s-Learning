            fullSummary: 'This first week of observation focused on three separate 4th-grade classrooms, each with a different physical layout. The goal was to identify potential environmental barriers or aids for students exhibiting dyslexic tendencies.',
            fullContent: `
                <p><strong>Classroom A (Traditional Rows):</strong> Students with suspected dyslexia appeared to have more difficulty tracking text on the main whiteboard, especially from the back of the room. There was a noticeable increase in "off-task" behavior, such as fidgeting or looking out the window, during periods of direct instruction.</p>
                <p><strong>Classroom B (Group Pods):</strong> This layout facilitated peer-to-peer support, which was a double-edged sword. While some students quietly received help from peers, others appeared to rely heavily on them, masking their own reading challenges. The noise level was also a significant factor, potentially creating a distracting environment for students who require high levels of concentration for decoding.</p>
                <p>Further research will involve interviewing the teachers from each classroom to correlate these observations with their own assessments.</p>

            fullSummary: 'This journal entry examines the use of text-to-speech (TTS) software and specialized fonts (e.g., OpenDyslexic) in a controlled setting. We provided two students, both with formal dyslexia diagnoses, access to tablets equipped with these tools.',
            fullContent: `
                <p><strong>Student 1 (Male, 9):</strong> Immediately gravitated towards the TTS feature. His comprehension scores on test materials improved by an average of 35% when using TTS versus reading unaided. However, he expressed reluctance to use the device "in front of everyone" for fear of appearing different.</p>
                <p><strong>Student 2 (Female, 10):</strong> Showed a strong preference for the specialized font, stating it made the letters "stop jumping." While her reading speed only increased marginally (8%), her self-reported reduction in visual stress and fatigue was significant.</p>
                <p>The key takeaway is not just the efficacy of the tools, but the critical importance of addressing the social-emotional component. The perceived stigma of using assistive technology can be as significant a barrier as the disability itself. Normalizing these tools as "just another way to learn" (like glasses or pencils) must be part of the implementation strategy.</p>
